        <img src="moi.jpg" alt="My pictures">
        <p>I am currently a student at EMLV Business School. I chose the International Track to improve my level of English and why not, work internationally later.
I follow the news of new technologies as much as possible to be up to date. I am always very focused, and I invest myself in the subjects that interest me but also very respectful and curious towards those I don't know. I like to learn and improve my general culture and perfect my current knowledge.</p>

                <h2>My Hobbies/passions</h2>
                <p>I love playing music, I play drums and I was even part of a band!🥁 I also spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking or making pastries,👨‍🍳 I even wanted to make it my job before. But what I love above all is playing video games,🖥 it allowed me to improve my English by putting the games in English but also made me a very creative person.</p>

                <h2>My Projects</h2>
                <p>I haven't achieved much in my life, or at least, I haven't finalized a project or set up a start-up. I still don't know what I really want to do in the future, but I'm thinking of going into commerce.</p>
